# US Tomorrow
## Mission: Make the US a full democracy. 
Is it just me or is an Article V Convention nearly impossible due to our nation's current system?

## Possible Motto
Peace. Truth. Law.

## FAQs

#### "Why do anything at all?":

I am thankful for the liberties granted to us in the [US Bill of Rights](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights-transcript) and the responsibilities of the [US Declaration of Independence](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript). I believe that the politicians in America and other countries are still beholden to the wealthy and that preserving this planet for generations to come won't be easy. 

**Fun fact:**
The US Declaration of Independence was adopted in 1776. This year marks the 247th year since its adoption. 

**Questions to consider:** 
What will this continent look like 247 years (c. 2270) from today? In addition, what will Earth look like in the year 2270? 
Will we have solved the climate emergency? 
Will the Earth still be habitable without advanced habitats?

#### "Why should we listen to you? You're not an expert in any of this":

No I'm not. I believe the issues we face require a strong central government to address planetary matters and decentralized governance for local day-to-day stuff. I believe what we have is not a full democracy. I have heard it referred to as "tyranny", "plutocracy", "monocracy", "theocracy" and "autocracy". While our economic system is referred to as "monopoly" and "oligopoly". 

We should learn from the problems of these current systems. I propose a **sociocratic** country. Sociocratic in **both** its political and economic systems.

I understand sociocracy fails if good people don't act. I want my generation (gen Z) not enter into a 'WWIII' with China, Russia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, India or any other country. With that being said, I'm not a dove nor a hawk. WWIII could be an easy victory for the US. But what if it is a stalemate. Countless lives would be lost for nothing. 

Citizens of this country should welcome those who need help in places like the Global South and work with as many countries as possible to build the technology needed.

Capitalism to its credit does not require much from the young. But what it takes from our elders is morally reprehensible. This is our World (War), we can't afford to waste time.

#### "I just want a decent paying job on a planet that's not boiling hot.":
